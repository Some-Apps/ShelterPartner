### How To Get Paid

If it's your first time getting paid, I will email you from jared@shelterpartner.org and post a verification code on GitHub. I will never ask for any information other than an email or username. Please be cautious of scams. If anything seems sketchy, it's probably a scam. Please report any potential scams to me.

If you are a US resident, you may be required to fill out a tax form when you receive the payment as you will be considered an independant contractor.

All international payments will be made via PayPal so make sure you have an account.

## How Bounties Work

   - New bounty issues start at **$5**
   - Each unassigned bounty increases by **$5** every week (7 days)
   - Maximum automatic bounty cap: **$100**
   - GitHub sponsors can increase bounties as a perk
   - The project manager can increase bounties as they see fit
